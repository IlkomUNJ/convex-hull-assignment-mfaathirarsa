# AI usage
For this assignment I consulted OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5) briefly, as a supplementary tool. My queries were limited and high-level, such as:

“Does my convex hull implementation correspond to the Monotone Chain algorithm?”

“What is the recommended project structure for a simple Qt Widgets application?”

The AI was used only for quick verification and to confirm best practices in structuring the project. The actual coding, debugging, and adaptation to the lecture’s pseudocode were carried out independently by me.
